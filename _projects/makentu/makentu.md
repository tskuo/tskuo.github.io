[MakeNTU](https://www.facebook.com/makentu.ntuee) (台大電機創客松) is an annual nationwide makeathon in Taiwan, organized by the National Taiwan University Electrical Engineering (NTUEE) undergraduate student association.

Each year, MakeNTU invites hundreds of undergraduate student makers across Taiwan to ideate, build, and showcase their projects in a 24-hour prototyping session.

## About

In 2017, Fan-Keng, Jim, and I co-chaired the inaugural MakeNTU, building upon a small-scale pilot in 2016. We aimed to promote the maker culture in Taiwan and encourage students to bring their ideas to life. In collaboration with the Taipei City Government and 22 sponsoring companies, MakeNTU 2017 invited 50 student maker teams (with 4 members each) to design and prototype projects centered around the theme of Smart City. Four teams clinched victory, each receiving a 50K prize for their outstanding demonstration of creativity, problem identification, technical contribution, and embodiment of the maker spirit.
