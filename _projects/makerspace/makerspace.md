[NTUEE Makerspace](https://www.facebook.com/ntuee.makerspace) stands as the first and only student-run facility of its kind at National Taiwan University, managed by the undergraduate student association of the Electrical Engineering Department.

The makerspace supports students in their pursuit of side projects by providing equipment for electronic prototyping and physical fabrication, such as CNC milling machines, laser cutters, 3D printers, and more. Additionally, it fosters a collaborative learning environment where senior students regularly organize workshops to teach junior students basic prototyping skills.

## Origin

In 2017, Fan-Keng, Jim, and I co-chaired the inaugural [MakeNTU](/projects/makentu/), the first nationwide makeathon in Taiwan. While the event was a huge success, we recognized the need for a physical space with prototyping tools to sustain engagement in the maker culture. We pitched the idea to the department but received pushback from the faculty. Eventually, we secured an unused room in an old building, where we started building the makerspace.

## Workshops and Projects

Since then, our students have initiated a series of workshops where seniors teach juniors basic prototyping skills, covering circuit design, 3D modeling and printing, etc. With these cultivated skills, students collaboratively bring their ideas to life. For example, our students designed clothing and the system for a light dance performance at the annual EE night.
